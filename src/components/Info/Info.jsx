                                        Well, in short, PCOS and PCOD is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or Disease.
                                        
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <u>Let's start with the basics.</u>
                                        <br/>
                                        All women have two ovaries which release an egg alternately every month. 
                                        These ovaries also produce female hormones that are responsible 
                                        for many things like fertility, period schedule, facial hair, 
                                        etc. apart from these, <strong>ovaries also produce androgens or male 
                                        hormones (Shocking? I know, but it's true!)</strong> but in very minute 
                                        quantities.

                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <u>Now, coming back to our original question: What is PCOS and PCOD?</u>
                                        <br/>
                                        PCOD and PCOS (more severe than PCOD, but we will discuss that later!)
                                        is a condition in which the ovaries contain many immature or partially 
                                        mature eggs which eventually turn into cysts. 

                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <strong>
                                            Hence Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (or Disease), meaning many cysts in the ovary.
                                        </strong>
                                        
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        The ovaries usually become enlarged and secrete large amounts of androgens (male hormone).
